## Firebase Directory

This directory contains all logic interacting with Firebase auth and Firestore. The files are loosely named after the redux concepts of actions and selectors, though the meaning does not indicate association with a reducer. Actions can be considered "setters" and selectors can be considered "getters", where both are performed on Firestore.
